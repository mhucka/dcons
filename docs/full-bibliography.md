...

The bibliography on this page comprises a large collection of references (600+) in the areas of Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Content-Centric Networking (CCN) and Named-Data Networking (NDN).  For convenience, separate pages provide references focused more narrowly on ICN, CCN, or NDN, but note that in many cases, references show up in more than one of the lists:

* [ICN bibliography](icn-bibliography.html)
* [CCN bibliography](ccn-bibliography.html)
* [NDN bibliography](ndn-bibliography.html)

For copyright reasons, we cannot publicly share the PDFs of the papers, but if you are working with the authors, please contact us and we will share the [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com) folder with you.
