          <p>This project is a work in progress. We are studying network architectures for <em>content-oriented networks</em>, that is, networks where the communications protocols center on accessing data by name rather than on sending data packets from a source to a destination address. The latter is the prevaling paradigm embodied in TCP/IP, which underlies much of the global Internet; the former is an approach originally pioneered in peer-to-peer networks and now under active development by numerous academic and commercial groups. The most prominent of these is the <a href="http://named-data.net"><em>named data networking</em> (NDN)</a> effort pursued under NSF funding by several research groups, but the general idea of content-addressed networking is broader and includes efforts such as the <a href="https://irtf.org/icnrg">Information-Centric Networking Research Group</a> at the IRTF, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://blockstack.org">Blockstack</a>, <a href="https://maidsafe.net">MaidSafe</a>, and others.</p>
          <p>We are particularly interested in decentralized and distributed efforts in this area. By <em>decentralized</em>, we mean systems where services and decisions are not concentrated in one or a few powerful entities, and are instead allocated throughout a network. By <em>distributed</em>, we mean systems in which resources (storage, processing, etc.) are distributed across multiple components that communicate with each other. Decentralization implies distribution, but not all distributed systems are decentralized.</p>
          <p>Does it make sense to qualify the term “content-oriented” or “content-addressed” with “decentralized”? Isn’t it redundant? The position put forward here is that, while networking is inherently about communication between distributed entities (why else would you have a network in the first place?), content addressing per se does not have to be implemented in a decentralized or distributed manner. In principle, a distributed network <em>could</em> implement content addressing in some kind of centralized way—it would probably not have the most desirable properties, but it is a viable point in the feature-space of architectures. However, we are interested in understanding the architectures and properties of truly decentralized systems because of their potential to possess highly desirable properties such as robustness against damage and degradation, resilience in the face of adversarial attacks, and more.</p>
          <p>Many technical problems will need to be solved before content-oriented networks become a significant part of network infrastructure in the world. Additional technical challenges enter into the picture when mobile and transiently-connected elements are involved, which has led to many active areas of work today in such things as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network">mobile ad hoc networks</a> (MANET) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking">delay tolerant networks</a> (DTN). How are these related to decentralized content-oriented networks? Can current efforts such as NDN and IPFS support mobility and delays?</p>
          <p>Those are the kinds of questions we hope to answer!</p>
