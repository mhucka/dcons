The bibliography on this page comprises a collection of references that discuss Information-Centric Networking (ICN).  The basic criterion for inclusion in this list is that the material explicitly mention ICN and is not entirely focused on NDN.  In some cases, discussions of ICN also include CCN, but in many cases they do not (e.g., this can be the case for papers that predate CCN as a concrete project in the mid-2000's).
